        <p>
            Dathar is a world entrenched in darkness, cursed by the reign of the Demon King, Zorath, whose power has held the land in thrall for two centuries. 
            The sky is perpetually cloaked in a thick blackness, casting a grim pall over the lands. The sun has not risen in two hundred years. Cities that once thrived with life now lie in ruin, their streets filled with desolate silence.

            Kaelen, a young man from the village of Rass, lives a quiet life in hiding, unaware of the role he is meant to play in this ancient tale. His days are spent hunting, 
            but he is troubled by strange dreams—visions of a radiant angel, with wings that shimmer like the dawn. These dreams leave Kaelen restless, as though some deeper force is stirring within him.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a small rebellion begins to stir in the village, an attack by Zorath’s forces shakes Kaelen’s peaceful existence. During the attack, Kaelen unknowingly displays extraordinary skills in combat—skills that seem to come from some distant part of him, 
            as if inherited from another life. This sparks the first clues that Kaelen is more than just an ordinary man.
