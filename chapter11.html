        <h2>Chapter 11: The Demon King’s Generals
        </h2>
        <p>Before Kaelen can face Zorath himself, he must overcome the four terrifying generals that serve as Zorath’s closest lieutenants. Each general is an embodiment of a dark aspect of Zorath’s reign—Kaelgar, the demon of vengeance; Lithara, the mistress of illusions; Garruk, the brutal warrior; and Selene, the manipulator of emotions.
        </p>
        <p>Kaelen’s first encounter is with Kaelgar, a demon who revels in the suffering of others. Kaelen’s anger begins to boil as Kaelgar kills several of the rebels in front of him, but he quickly learns that his anger only feeds Kaelgar’s power. To defeat him, Kaelen must find a way to quell his fury and fight with clarity and resolve. This encounter is a lesson in self-mastery.
        </p>
        <p>
            
Next, Kaelen faces Lithara, whose illusions blur the line between reality and nightmare. Trapped in a labyrinth of illusions, Kaelen must rely on his instincts and the wisdom passed down from Seraphiel to navigate the treacherous world Lithara creates. This trial pushes Kaelen’s mind to the brink of madness, but in overcoming it, he gains deeper understanding of his true self.

        <p>The third general, Garruk, is the embodiment of physical strength and brutal violence. Kaelen faces him in a brutal one-on-one battle, testing his combat skills and endurance. Garruk’s sheer might pushes Kaelen to the limit, but with Lira’s help, Kaelen learns to fight with purpose, not just power.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, Kaelen faces Selene, whose manipulations target his emotions and fears. Selene forces Kaelen to confront his greatest doubts, playing on his uncertainty about his destiny and the Chapter 11: The Demon King’s Generals

This battle is not just physical—it is an emotional and psychological war. Kaelen is forced to confront his inner darkness and make peace with the man he has become.
        </p>
        <p>By defeating each of the generals, Kaelen learns more about himself and grows stronger, but each victory comes with a heavy price. The rebel forces are battered and broken, but they are now ready for the final confrontation with Zorath.
