        <p></p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the battle with Zorath’s generals, Kaelen begins to unravel. The emotional toll of his victories, combined with the weight of his divine heritage, begins to break him down. Kaelen begins to question whether he is truly capable of defeating Zorath, or if the power he wields will consume him, just as it consumed Zorath.

            This chapter delves deeply into Kaelen’s psyche, showing his inner turmoil and self-doubt. He contemplates whether the world would be better off without him, and if his death at the hands of Zorath might be the only way to truly restore balance. The people around him, especially Lira, try to support him, but Kaelen’s isolation deepens as he grapples with his fears.

            As Kaelen struggles with his shattered soul, he has a vision of Seraphiel, who reminds him that even in the darkest moments, redemption is possible. This vision sparks something within Kaelen, a renewed sense of purpose. He realizes that his journey is not just about defeating Zorath—it’s about embracing both his light and his darkness and learning to use them together.</p>
