        <h2>Chapter 7: : The Awakening</h2>
        <p>Kaelen’s transformation continues as he begins to awaken his full celestial powers. The angelic visions become more vivid, and Kaelen starts to remember his past life as Seraphiel in greater detail. He relives moments of his former existence—his role as a protector of the divine order, his bond with Zorath before the betrayal, and the catastrophic consequences of their fall. These memories both empower and torment Kaelen, who is unsure of his place in this world.

        <p>His growing connection with Lira and the other rebels deepens, but Kaelen knows that their time is running out. Zorath’s forces are closing in, and the rebellion is on the brink of collapse. Kaelen realizes that his destiny is not just to defeat Zorath—it is to restore balance to the world and undo the damage that both he and Zorath caused in the past.
        </p>

        <p>This chapter explores Kaelen’s journey of self-discovery and his struggle to balance his angelic nature with his mortal existence. It also sets the stage for the final confrontation with Zorath, as Kaelen prepares to face his former ally in a battle that will determine the fate of Dathar.</p>
