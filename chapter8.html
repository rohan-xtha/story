        <h2>Chapter 8: The Fall of the Light</h2>
        <p>This chapter focuses on Zorath's past, offering insight into his tragic transformation from a noble celestial warrior to the dark and tyrannical Demon King. Through Kaelen’s dreams and memories, we learn that Zorath once served as a powerful guardian of light, dedicated to protecting the balance of the world. However, Zorath’s desire for greater power led him to betray the divine order, turning against his fellow celestial beings and, in doing so, sealing his own fall from grace.
