        <h2>Chapter 17: The Price of Light</h2>
        <p>The death of Zorath reverberates across the land, and Kaelen finds himself alone in the aftermath. The rebels have won the battle, but the world is still shrouded in darkness. Kaelen stands on the edge of Zorath’s throne room, contemplating the destruction and desolation left in his wake. Despite the victory, there is no immediate sign of the dawn that the Heart of the Light was meant to bring.

            This chapter is deeply introspective. Kaelen begins to question the true cost of his victory. Has he truly won? The world is free from Zorath’s tyranny, but the scars of war are deep. The people are shattered, and the land is in ruins. The Heart of the Light pulses weakly in his hands, and Kaelen realizes that even with Zorath’s death, the world’s balance is still fragile. Light cannot exist without darkness, and the forces of nature require both to survive.
            </p>
        <p>Kaelen feels the weight of this truth, and he knows that the journey is not over. He must rebuild, not just defeat the remnants of Zorath’s followers, but also restore hope to the people. With Lira by his side, Kaelen makes the difficult decision to use the Heart’s power, not to destroy, but to heal and renew. He sacrifices a part of his own essence, channeling the energy of the Heart to begin the slow process of restoring the sun, and with it, the world’s balance.</p>
