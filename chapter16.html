        <h2>Chapter 16: The Demon King Revealed</h2>
        <p>Kaelen’s forces are inside the citadel now, and the rebel army is pushing forward toward the throne room where Zorath awaits. The entire structure feels alive, pulsing with dark energy as if the citadel itself is a manifestation of Zorath’s twisted soul. As Kaelen leads the charge toward the throne room, he is confronted with visions—memories of his time as Seraphiel, flashes of his betrayal by Zorath, and the anguish of his fall from grace.
        </p>
        <p>When Kaelen finally reaches Zorath’s throne room, he is faced with the Demon King himself. Zorath is an imposing figure, clad in armor forged from the darkness itself. His once-glorious wings are now blackened and torn, and his eyes burn with the malice of a thousand souls. The moment they meet, Kaelen feels the weight of their shared history pressing down on him. Zorath taunts Kaelen, reminding him that they were once allies, and suggesting that Kaelen’s destiny is merely to replace him, to become the next ruler of the world in his stead.

            Kaelen resists Zorath’s words, knowing that he must not succumb to the same darkness that claimed his former ally. The chapter culminates in a climactic showdown, with Kaelen wielding both the Heart of the Light and the Angel’s Blade. The battle between Kaelen and Zorath is both physical and psychological, as each tries to outmaneuver the other in a contest of wills.

            Zorath attempts to break Kaelen by manipulating his emotions, exploiting his doubts and fears. The demon king’s voice is full of venom, but Kaelen’s heart is strong. He remembers the sacrifices made by those who have supported him, the friends and comrades who believed in his mission. With one final surge of power, Kaelen strikes Zorath down, but not before Zorath reveals a final twist: his fall was not just a quest for power—it was a desperate attempt to reshape the world, to prevent its inevitable decay.
            </p>
            <P>The Demon King falls, but in his death, he whispers a final warning to Kaelen: "This world is not meant to survive. You will only prolong its suffering."</P>
