        <h2>Chapter 4: The Black Legion</h2>
        <p>The Black Legion is the most formidable army ever assembled in Dathar. Comprised of demons, corrupted beasts, and fallen angels, the Legion is the instrument of Zorath’s rule, a force of destruction that sweeps across the land, crushing any resistance and enslaving those who survive. The Legion is led by Zorath’s four most powerful generals, each of whom embodies a different aspect of darkness.</p>

        <p>In this chapter, Kaelen and the rebels come face-to-face with the first wave of the Legion. As they infiltrate a remote village, they discover that it has been razed to the ground by Zorath’s forces. The survivors are few, and they live in fear of Zorath’s demons, who patrol the land in search of rebels. Kaelen and the rebels launch a daring attack on the Legion’s supply line, hoping to disrupt their forces and gain a foothold in the war. As they engage in battle, Kaelen is forced to confront the true horrors of Zorath’s rule. The demons are not just mindless beasts—they are intelligent and ruthless, driven by a dark will that seems to emanate from Zorath himself.
        </p>
        <p>The battle is brutal, and Kaelen witnesses the first real taste of the enemy’s overwhelming power. As Kaelen fights, he begins to understand that defeating Zorath will not be easy—it will require more than just strength or skill. To overcome the Legion, Kaelen will have to tap into the deeper well of his angelic power. This chapter also explores Kaelen’s relationship with his companions, particularly Lira, who is determined to avenge her family’s death at the hands of Zorath’s generals. As the two grow closer, Kaelen realizes that the rebellion is more than just a political movement—it is a chance for redemption, not just for him, but for all the people of Dathar.
        </p>

        <p>
            The chapter ends with Kaelen emerging victorious, but at great cost. Several of the rebels have been killed in the battle, and Kaelen begins to feel the weight of the responsibility that comes with his newfound power. He knows that the war against Zorath is far from over, and that the real battle lies ahead.</p>
