        </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Kaelen’s sacrifice begins to bear fruit as the skies slowly clear, and the first rays of sunlight break through the long-lasting darkness. The people, weary and beaten, begin to rebuild their shattered homes and lives. The land, too, begins to heal, though it will take generations for the scars of war to fully fade. Kaelen’s actions inspire hope, and many of the people see him as a true savior—though Kaelen knows that he is only one part of a much larger cycle.

        <p>This chapter celebrates Kaelen’s triumph, but it also acknowledges the challenges ahead. As the sun returns, so does the threat of new darkness. Kaelen understands that the world will never be free from struggle. However, he now knows that hope is something that can be nurtured, not just a fleeting moment of light.
